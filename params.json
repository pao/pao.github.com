{"name":"Patrick O'Leary's GitHub Projects","tagline":"","body":"## Julia\r\nThe [Julia language](http://julialang.org/) is a fast, JIT-compiled, dynamic language designed for the needs of scientific and numerical computing but made to be usable as a general-purpose language. ([GitHub](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia), [my fork](https://github.com/pao/julia))\r\n\r\n### [Monads.jl](https://github.com/pao/Monads.jl) ([docs](https://monadsjl.readthedocs.org/))\r\n\r\nStarting from a solution to the final problem in *[Seven Languages in Seven Weeks](http://pragprog.com/book/btlang/seven-languages-in-seven-weeks)*, an implementation of several common monads as well as a macro which implements syntax similar to Haskell's `do` notation.\r\n\r\n### [StrPack.jl](https://github.com/pao/StrPack.jl) ([docs](https://strpackjl.readthedocs.org/))\r\n\r\nThe binary data stream Swiss army knife. Chop streams into structures, or put structures into streams, while keeping to arbitrarily-defined requirements for alignment and insertion of padding.\r\n\r\n### [QuickCheck.jl](https://github.com/pao/QuickCheck.jl) ([docs](https://quickcheckjl.readthedocs.org/))\r\n\r\nJulia's implementation of Haskell's famous [QuickCheck](http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~rjmh/QuickCheck/manual.html) specification-based randomized testing framework.\r\n\r\n## Android\r\n\r\n### [Crystal Reflection Live Wallpaper](https://github.com/pao/n4lwp)\r\n\r\nThis live wallpaper imitates the backplate of LG's Nexus 4.\r\n\r\n### [DataCross](https://github.com/pao/DataCross)\r\n\r\n(incomplete) Autocross datalogging tool.\r\n\r\n### [GUSTO: Gui Used to Setup TheOfficial](https://github.com/pao/GUSTO)\r\n\r\nA settings application for the TheOfficial ROM for the HTC Dream (T-Mobile G1) and Magic (T-Mobile myTouch 3G).\r\n\r\n## Experiments\r\n\r\n### [CreatureBattle](https://github.com/pao/creaturebattle)\r\n\r\n(MATLAB, Haskell, Python) The CreatureBattle system was originally determined to settle which of two hybrid animals would win in a fight (i.e., crocopottomocopter vs. Siberian gorilloctoshark), but it's generic enough to settle disputes about any two arbitrary things which are expressible as strings. Besides the canonical MATLAB version, there are also interoperable Python and Haskell implementations.\r\n\r\n### [Re2.jl](https://github.com/pao/Re2.jl)\r\n\r\n(incomplete) My attempt to create an alternative to Julia's standard PCRE-based regex engine using the Google re2 DFA-based engine and the [cre2](https://github.com/marcomaggi/cre2) C API. Very unstable.\r\n\r\n## Gists\r\n\r\n### [CyanogenMOD EC2 development environment setup](https://gist.github.com/pao/707468)\r\n\r\n(Shell) Scripts for initializing and managing CyanogenMOD development environments on Amazon EC2 instances. May not work anymore; last used for CM7.\r\n\r\n### [Emacs Client Smartframe](https://gist.github.com/pao/468997)\r\n\r\n(Shell) Script which can be used as `EDITOR`, automatically starts `emacsclient` if needed, but never opens a new frame if one is available. Also provides a shell alias `edit` which is useful if you like Emacs, but still want to mostly work from a traditional shell.\r\n\r\n### [getHeart](https://gist.github.com/pao/1645701)\r\n\r\n(Python) Batch downloader of digital materials for participants in Jonathan Coulton's Artificial Heart Level 4.\r\n\r\n### [Jo(de)Co(der)](https://gist.github.com/pao/1428218)\r\n\r\n(Python) A script which decodes the easter-egg image in the Artificial Heart Level 4 Javascript \"game.\" The base-64 encoded image appeared to be accidentally mangled in the process of (hilariously) obfuscating the rest of the program. This script solves for the replaced strings and outputs the original PNG.\r\n\r\n### [Linux kernel module template](https://gist.github.com/pao/619505)\r\n\r\n(C) Tiny template for a Linux kernel module.\r\n\r\n### [MLP Music Archive update script helper](https://gist.github.com/pao/2280993)\r\n\r\n(Python) Compares two directories and outputs both a Windows batch and Unix shell script which deletes files and paths that don't exist in the new directory. Used for a couple of releases.\r\n\r\n## Just for fun\r\n\r\n### [Cards Against Equinity](https://github.com/berrycardsagainsthumanity/cah) ([my fork](https://github.com/pao/cah))\r\n\r\n(Python, Javascript) A live online version of [Cards Against Humanity](http://www.cardsagainsthumanity.com/) played over websockets all running in [Twisted Python](http://twistedmatrix.com/). My primary contribution was a drastic simplification of the backend, consolidating everything onto Twisted and using flat files for the modest amount of data.
